## OpenGrid Configuration

One easy way to customize OpenGrid's behavior is to set the various available configuration options in `src/js/custom/Config.js`.

The settings are described below.

### Available Settings
#### brand
* *applicationName* - application name used on login screen, window title, and top navigation pane
* *copyright* - placeholder for copyright information; not currently used by application (internal use only)
* *version* - placeholder for version info; not currently  used by application (internal use only)

#### session
* *timeout* - session timeout, in minutes; if no user activity is detected (including mouse, keyboard and query requests) within this 
time period, the user is automatically logged out and redirected to the login screen
* *tokenRenewalInterval* - token renewal interval in minutes; the application uses tokens to securely send credential information 
to the service layer; the security token is initially generated by the service and has an expiration (4 hours by default); this setting should 
be set to a value less than the expiration period on the service side to prevent any session interruptions (manifest as permission errors on the UI) caused by
expired token

#### alerts
* *autoCloseDuration* - number of milliseconds the alert message will be displayed; this is the window that displays when there are informational or error messages

#### table
Various table-related settings; these are *pass-through* settings that normally don't need to be changed

#### map
* *baseLayers* - layer information including Leaflet-supported URL of the layer (See http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#tilelayer for more info)
* *overlayLayers* - layer information for overlays; much like the baseLayers, the overlayLayers need URLs that point to a Leaflet-supported map service
* *mapLibraryOptions.center* - default map center in Latitude/Longitude
* *mapLibraryOptions.zoom* - default map zoom (use higher value to zoom in)
* *mapLibraryOptions.minZoom* - map's minimum zoom level
* *mapLibraryOptions.imagePath* - default path for images used by Leaflet; there is no need to change this, in most cases
* *zoomToResultsExtent* - flag to indicate if the map will auto-zoom after a 'manual' search (via quick or advanced search, not auto-refresh)
* *measureOptions* - some settings used by the measuring tool class
* *tileMapOptions* - tile map options to be made available on the UI; shapeMap setting is an instance of ogrid.ShapeMap class that exposes a shape map data (geoJson) representing a boundary

#### quickSearch
* *mock* - for testing use only (deprecated)
* *plugins* - list of plug-ins for handling quick searches
* *helpFile* - quick search help content
* *plugInOptions* - options used by quick search plug-ins; right now, only the Places plug-in, the default plug-in that gets called when no other plug-in matches the quick search text, is reading these settings
  1. *places.esriGeocodeBBox* - the bounding box used for the ArcGIS World Geocoder service to perform the address/POI search within the given extent; bounding rectangle coordinates can be entered as a simple comma-separated string in the format <lower left corner>,<upper right corner>
  2. *places.esriGeocodeLocation* - Longitude/Latitude value that represents the center of the search area; if more than 1 search results are returned by the service, the results nearest to this point will appear first on the list of results
  3. *places.esriGeocodeMaxResults* - maximum results to be returned by the ArcGIS Geocode service
  4. *places.esriGeocodeFilterUsingShape* - when specific address/locations are returned by the ArcGIS Geocoder service, the search results are filtered to make sure only results inside this *shape* or boundary are returned

#### advancedSearch
* *geoFilterBoundaries* - boundaries used on Advanced Search; the data attribute should be set to a geoJson value that represents the boundary

#### commandBar
* *commands* - list of buttons and required security level
* *mobileBreakPointWidth* - width value of the browser window used for internally determining if application is in *mobile mode* or in normal mode (note that this should be in sync with the value used by Bootstrap/bootstrap.css for its media queries)

 
#### service
* *endpoint* - the endpoint of the service layer that OpenGrid application calls; this is the default setting used which is overriden by the one found in `config/EnvSettings.js`
* *timeout* - the timeout value of every service call, in milliseconds; if a service call times out, an alert message is displayed
* *maxresults* - the maximum number of rows to return for a query
* *authUrl* - the URL of the operation to use for retrieving a security token during the login process; there is usually no need to change this unless the service layer is configured or developed to use a different URL
* *authRenewUrl* - the URL of the operation to use for renewing a security token
* *errorHandler* - internal setting to indicate the class to use for handling some exceptions
* *dateFormat* - data format used for converting string to date value for comparing dates on auto-refresh highlighting; this is dependent on the format used by the underlying service
* *autoLogin* - flag to indicate if login page will be displayed or if application will automatically login using credentials specified in *autologinUserId* and *autologinPassword*
* *autologinUserId* - user id to use for internal login when autoLogin is set to 'true'
* *autologinPassword* - password to use for internal login when autoLogin is set to 'true'

#### help
* *url* - url to use for the application help link
* *type* - the type of help link: 'icon' or 'button'
