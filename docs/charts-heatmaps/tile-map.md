# How to Create a Tile Map

Tile maps (choropleth) will use shading, instead of individual points, to show the amount of data by different regions. Tile maps can be generated from the table grid window.


1. Plot the data you want to display.

2. Expand the table grid and hover on the Tile Map icon and select the tile type you want to display.

# Removing/Hiding Tile Map

To remove the tile from the grid select the option "None" from the droplist. Alternatively, you can click on the "Layer" button and temporarily hide the tile map from the ["Generated Layers"](../map-layers/index.md#available-layers) section.
